# Target Audience

This project, encompassing the `mks-servo-can` Python library and the `mks-servo-simulator`, is aimed at a diverse group of users who work with MKS SERVO42D and MKS SERVO57D motors or similar CAN-bus controlled servo systems. The ideal users include:

* **Robotics Engineers and Hobbyists:** Individuals and teams developing robotic systems that require precise motor control. The asynchronous nature of the library is well-suited for applications needing responsive and concurrent motor operations.
* **CNC Machine Developers and Users:** Those building or retrofitting CNC machinery where MKS servo motors are used for axis control. The kinematics engine can help translate machine coordinates to motor movements.
* **Automation System Integrators:** Professionals designing automated systems for manufacturing, assembly, or other industrial processes that leverage these types of servo motors.
* **Python Developers:** Programmers looking for a Python-based solution to interface with MKS CAN servos, especially those who prefer or require asynchronous programming paradigms (`asyncio`).
* **Educators and Students:** Academic users in fields like mechatronics, robotics, and control systems can use the library and simulator as a learning tool for understanding servo motor control and CAN bus communication without always needing expensive physical setups.
* **Researchers:** Scientists and researchers developing experimental setups that require automated and precise motion control provided by MKS servo motors.
* **Software Developers and Testers:** Those who need to develop or test software that interacts with MKS servo motors can heavily benefit from the `mks-servo-simulator` for creating reproducible test environments and for development without direct hardware access.

The library aims to be accessible for users with varying levels of experience with CAN bus protocols, offering both low-level command access for experts and a higher-level API for more straightforward application development.
