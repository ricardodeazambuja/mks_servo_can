# Unused Code and Files Report

This report summarizes the findings regarding unused files and code within the `mks-servo-can` project.

## Unused Files

The following files appear to be unused and are likely backup files that can be removed:

*   `tests/integration/test_with_simulator.py.bak`
*   `tests/unit/test_axis.py.bak`
*   `tests/unit/test_low_level_api.py.bak`
*   `tests/unit/test_multi_axis_controller.py.bak`
*   `tests/unit/test_robot_kinematics.py.bak`

No other Python files were identified as being completely unused. Utility scripts (`check_docstrings.py`, `clean.sh`) and setup files (`setup.py`) are assumed to be in use.

## Unused Code Within Files

A manual spot-check was performed to identify potentially unused internal code (e.g., private methods).

For example, the private method `_raw_encoder_steps_to_command_microsteps` in `mks_servo_can_library/mks_servo_can/axis.py` was initially investigated as it was not called by other methods within the same `axis.py` file. However, a repository-wide search using `grep` revealed that this method is used by integration tests (`tests/integration/test_with_simulator.py`). This confirms the method is in use and necessary for testing purposes.

A comprehensive and fully automated analysis to find all unused functions, methods, or classes within used files is complex and would ideally require dedicated static analysis tools. Such an in-depth analysis is beyond the scope of this manual review.

Based on the current review, no specific production code blocks within the main library or simulator have been definitively identified as unused.

## Docstring Coverage

An automated scan using the `ast` module was performed on all Python files to check for the presence of basic docstrings for every function, method, and class.

The scan revealed that while many core components are well-documented, a significant number of functions, methods (especially `__init__` methods), and classes are missing docstrings. These omissions are spread across:
- Example scripts (`examples/`)
- Test files (`tests/`)
- Some parts of the main library (`mks_servo_can_library/`)
- Some parts of the simulator code (`mks_servo_simulator/`)

Addressing all missing docstrings to meet Google Python standards would be a substantial undertaking. For this review, docstrings were added to:
- `RRRArm.__init__` in `mks_servo_can_library/mks_servo_can/robot_kinematics.py`
- `Kinematics.__repr__` in `mks_servo_can_library/mks_servo_can/kinematics/base_kinematics.py`

It is recommended that a separate, dedicated effort be made to achieve comprehensive docstring coverage across the entire project.
