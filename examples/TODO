1. Change the --no-simulator / --use-simulator to just ONE argument
2. Improve the height_map_generator.py. Maybe it could become a multi-motor digitizer as a base class (separate file)
2.1. Ideally, I should be able to use the digitizer as a way to test the precision of the system by recording something and playing it back
3. Fix the documentation that is outdated
4. Test all the examples (not sure how to do it with the robot arm ones)
5. Are we controlling speeds and accelerations properly?
